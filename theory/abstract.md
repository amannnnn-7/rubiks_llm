The goal is to attempt to create a representation of a Rubik's Cube in Python with corresponding conventional move notations and prompt an LLM for instructions on how to go about solving.
The project aims to explore the symbolic reasoning capabilities of LLMs involving algorithmic thinking and mathematical / spatial puzzles in the form of a Rubik's Cube.
Though it appears to be a hard task, this also allows the opportunity to compare, test and enhance model capabilities using various prompting tools such as CoT (Chain of Thought) or ToT (Tree of Thought) or
look for new methods and frameworks that allow models to take on challenging problems.
